Sim events:

Any event that fires on a pokemon also fires on that pokemon's side. So, for instance,
the global event TryHit, which is run on the target of a move, is also intercepted
by the onTryHit handler of Mat Block, a side condition on the target's side.

Any event that fires on a side also fires on the global field. So, for instance,
the global Effectiveness event can be captured by Delta Stream, a weather condition.

=== LIST OF SINGLE EVENTS ===

**Note**: This list is incomplete.
Consult dev-tools/globals.ts for a full list, including function signatures, of the
single events available on abilities, moves, items or statuses, corresponding to the
AbilityEventMethods, MoveEventMethods, ItemEventMethods and PureEffectEventMethods
interfaces.

Single events run on moves are passed copies of the move objects. These are called
"Active Moves", and can be safely modified.

beforeMoveCallback(user, target, move) [on move]
	Fired before a pokemon uses a move it chose, but after the global
	BeforeMove event. Return true to prevent the move.

	Moves not called directly (e.g. moves called by Assist, Metronome, or Sleep Talk)
	do not fire this event.

	examples: [move] Focus Punch

beforeTurnCallback(user) [on move]
	Fired before a turn starts on every pokemon which will move.

	Used for Focus Punch (for the "focusing" message) and Pursuit
	(to activate the side condition that listens for the foeSwitchOut
	event).

	examples: [move] Focus Punch, [move] Pursuit

onModifyMove(move, user, target) [on move]
	Fired before a pokemon uses a move.

	It is also fired for moves that bypass beforeMoveCallback
	(moves called by Assist, Metronome, or Sleep Talk).

	NOTE: Base Power modifications should be handled in onBasePower, not in
	onModifyMove. This is because many moves have variable base power.

	NOTE: Priority modifications should be handled in the global event onModifyPriority.
	By the time the move can be modified through onModifyMove, its position in the
	decision queue is already fixed.

	examples: [move] Secret Power, [move] Technoblast, [move] Weather Ball

onStart(pokemon) [on ability]
onStart(pokemon) [on item]
	Fired after a pokemon switches in, following the onSwitchIn event.

	If two pokemon switch in at once (first turn, or after two pokemon
	faint simultaneously), both onStart events will fire after both pokemon
	have switched in, and the faster pokemon's onStart event will fire
	first.

	examples: [ability] Drizzle, [ability] Intimidate, [item] Air Balloon

=== LIST OF GLOBAL EVENTS ===

**Note**: This list is incomplete.
Consult dev-tools/globals.ts for a full list, including function signatures, of the
global events available, corresponding to the EventMethods interface.

onBeforeMove(user, target, move) [on user]
	Fired before a pokemon uses a move it chose. Return false to prevent
	the move.

	Mostly effects that prevent a user from moving, such as paralysis.

	Moves not called directly (e.g. moves called by Metronome, Sleep Talk,
	or Pursuit) do not fire this event.

	examples: [volatile] Flinching, [status] fully paralyzed,
	          [move] Focus Punch

onBasePower(basePower, attacker) [on move]
onBasePower(basePower, attacker, defender, move) [on user]
onFoeBasePower(basePower, attacker, defender, move) [on target]
	Fired while calculating a move's base power. Return the modified
	base power.

	examples: [ability] Technician, [foe side condition] Reflect,
	          [move] Gyro Ball

onBeforeTurn(pokemon) [on pokemon]
	Fired before a turn starts on every active pokemon.

	Used for Gen 4 Custap Berry and the Gen 2 Locked Move volatile,
	to dynamically update the decision queue.

	examples: [item] Custap Berry (Gen 4), [volatile] Locked Move (Gen 2)

onDamage(user, target) [on target]
	Fired while calculating damage, either from a move or from a condition.
	Return a damage value directly in HP. Bypasses weaknesses and resistances,
	but not immunities.

	examples: [ability] Magic Guard, [volatile] Endure

onModifyMove(user, target, move) [on user]
onFoeModifyMove(user, target, move) [on target]
	Fired before a pokemon uses a move.

	examples: [ability] Adaptability, [ability] Infiltrator, [ability] Pixilate

onType(pokemon) [on pokemon]
	Fired when calculating the type of a Pokémon to override the default typing mechanics.
	Only used for Roost, Arceus, and Silvally.

	examples: [volatile] Roost, [pokemon] Arceus, [pokemon] Silvally

onSwitchIn(pokemon) [on pokemon]
	Fired after a pokemon switches in.

	If two pokemon switch in at once (first turn, or after two pokemon
	faint simultaneously), both onSwitchIn events will fire after both pokemon
	have switched in, and the faster pokemon's onSwitchIn event will fire
	first.

	examples: [side condition] Stealth Rock, [slot condition] Healing Wish

onBeforeSwitchOut(pokemon) [on pokemon]
	Fired before a pokemon switches out.

	examples: [side condition] Pursuit

onSwitchOut(pokemon) [on pokemon]
	Fired before a pokemon switches out, after the onBeforeSwitchOut event.
	Return true to interrupt and prevent the pokemon from switching out.

	NOTE: DO NOT use it to implement trapping: set the trapping flag in
	the onFoeTrapPokemon event instead.

	NOTE: NOTHING in USUM or earlier prevents a pokemon from switching out
	at this stage, so you most likely DO NOT want to ever return true.

	examples: [ability] Natural Cure, [ability] Regenerator

onImmunity(type, target) [on target]
	Fired when determining whether or not a pokemon is immune to a move.
	Return false if it is immune.

	examples: [volatile] Magnet Rise

onImmunity(effectid, target) [on target]
	Fired when determining whether or not a pokemon is immune to a non-move effect.
	Return false if it is immune.

	examples: [ability] Magma Armor, [ability] Overcoat, [item] Safety Goggles

================================ WIP line =================================
getHit(target, source, move) [on target]
foeGetHit(target, source, move) [on source]
hit(target, source) [on move]
	Fired when a move hits (doesn't miss). Return true to prevent the move's
	effects.

	Also used for moves whose effects are too complicated to be represented
	in any other way.

	examples: [foe volatile] Protect, [move] Belly Drum, etc

movePriority(priority, user, target, move) [on user]
foeMovePriority(priority, user, target, move) [on target]
	Fired when determining a move's priority. Return the move's priority.

	examples: [ability] Prankster

start(pokemon, source) [on status, on volatile]
start(side, source) [on side condition]
start(placeholder, source) [on weather, on field effect]
	Fired when an effect starts.

	source is the pokemon that inflicted the effect, or null if no such
	pokemon did. For instance, if Pikachu uses Toxic, source is Pikachu,
	but if you are poisoned by Toxic Spikes, source is null.

	Useful for cancelling an effect that fails (e.g. Encore against a newly
	switched-in foe), for giving messages that an effect has started, and
	for initializing effect data (e.g. Substitute, Wish).

	NOTE: Not fired for abilities and items. For abilities and items, see
	the switchIn event.

	examples: [volatile] Encore, [side condition] Reflect,
	          [volatile] Substitute

restart(pokemon) [on status, on volatile]
restart(side) [on side condition]
restart() [on weather, on field effect]
	Fired when trying to induce an effect that's already active.

	Useful for effects that can have multiple "layers".

	examples: [side condition] Toxic Spikes, [side condition] Pursuit,
	          [volatile] Stockpile

end(pokemon) [on status, on volatile, on item, on ability]
end(side) [on side condition]
end() [on weather, on field effect]
	Fired when an effect ends naturally, usually because its duration ends.
	Return true to stop an effect from ending.

	Most ways an effect can end are "natural". The biggest exception is
	when a pokemon swiches out. In general, if you would receive a message
	when the effect ends, the end event would be fired.

	NOTE: NOT fired when a pokemon switches out (see switchOut).

	NOTE: If you return true when an event expires from its duration counter
	      reaching 0, it will never expire unless you reset its duration. To
	      extend an effect by one turn, simply set its duration counter to 1
	      before returning true.

	Useful for giving messages that an effect has ended.

	examples: [volatile] Encore, [side condition] Reflect,
	          [volatile] Substitute

duration(pokemon, source) [on status, on volatile]
duration(side) [on side condition]
duration() [on weather, on field effect]
	Fired while calculating an effect's duration. Returns the duration in
	turns, including the current one.

	source is the pokemon that inflicted the effect, or null if no such
	pokemon did. For instance, if Pikachu uses Toxic, source is Pikachu,
	but if you are poisoned by Toxic Spikes, source is null.

	For instance, Protect has a duration of 1 turn, and Wish has a duration
	of 2 turns. Return 0 to have it never expire.

	The effect's residual event is not fired when it expires - instead, its
	end event is fired when its residual event would otherwise have fired.

	Do not use this for effects that don't expire during a residual. For
	instance, sleep expires through a sleep counter that decrements every
	beforeMove event, not every residual event.

	examples: [weather] Rain Dance, [side condition] Reflect

residual(pokemon) [on status, on volatile, on ability, on item]
residual(side) [on side condition]
residual() [on weather, on field effect]
	Fired at the end of each turn, but before fainted pokemon are switched in.

	Useful for whatever end-of-turn effects this may have.

	The duration counter of each effect is decremented automatically before
	this event is fired (see duration for details).

	examples: [volatile] Ghost-type Curse, [weather] Sandstorm


=== DETAILED USAGE NOTES ===

In Pokémon Showdown, as well as in Pokémon Lab (https://pokemonlab.com/) and
DougJustDoug's framework, everything in Pokémon is an effect.

There are 10 types of effects
- move, associated with a pokemon (Grass Knot, Magnitude...)
- status, associated with a pokemon (Sleep, Poison...)
- volatile, associated with a pokemon (Protect, Substitute...)
- ability, associated with a pokemon (Intimidate, Technician...)
- item, associated with a pokemon (Leftovers, Choice Scarf...)
- slot condition, associated with a position (Wish, Healing Wish)
- side condition, associated with a side (Reflect, Tailwind...)
- terrain, associated with the field (Grassy Terrain, Misty Terrain...)
- weather, associated with the field (Rain Dance, Sunny Day...)
- pseudoweather, asociated with the field (Trick Room...)

Effects associated with a side are also associated with every pokemon on a side,
and effects associated with the field are associated with every pokemon.

For convenience, most effects have the same ID as the move, ability, or item that
induces it. The only exceptions are effects with many moves associated with them,
such as statuses, and certain volatile statuses (flinch, confusion, locked moves,
and trapping).

Nearly every effect has some sort of event listener, and each action fires an
event.

For instance, here is the Technician ability:

"Technician": {
	desc: "This Pokemon's moves of 60 power or less have their power multiplied
		by 1.5. Does affect Struggle.",
	shortDesc: "This Pokemon's moves of 60 power or less have 1.5x power. Includes
		Struggle.",
	onBasePowerPriority: 8,
	onBasePowerPriority(basePower, attacker, defender, move) {
		if (basePower <= 60) {
			this.debug('Technician boost');
			return this.chainModify(1.5);
		}
	},
	id: "Technician",
	name: "Technician",
 	rating: 4,
	num: "101"
}

Now, let's work through an example:

> In a Doubles Battle with Grassy Terrain active, and with an allied Battery Charjabug
on the field, a Technician Roserade uses Grass Knot against a Dry Skin Helioptile.

This fires the BasePower event:

onBasePower(user, target) [on move]
onBasePower(user, target, basePower, move) [on user]
onAllyBasePower(user, target, basePower, move) [on allies]
onFoeBasePower(user, target, basePower, move) [on foes]
onSourceBasePower(user, target, basePower, move) [on target]
onAnyBasePower(user, target, basePower, move) [on every Pokémon]

First, the basePowerCallback handler on the move is fired.

Grass Knot's basePowerCallback function returns 60 as its Base Power against
Helioptile.

Next, all BasePower handlers associated with Roserade targetting Helioptile are fired.
This includes the following:
- onBasePower handlers of Roserade's effects (its Technician ability)
- onBasePower handlers of Roserade's teams's effects (there are none)
- onBasePower handlers of the battle effects (Grassy Terrain).
- onAllyBasePower handlers of the allied Charjabug (its Battery ability)
- onFoeBasePower handlers of both active opponents (Helioptile's Dry Skin ability),
- onSourceBasePower handlers of the targetted Helioptile
- onAnyBasePower handlers of every active Pokémon

These handlers are sorted by their listed priority.

The Technician callback goes first, since it has a priority of 8.
so it updates the base power modifier from its initial value of 1 to 1.5.

Next, the Battery handler is called, since it also has a priority of 8,
so the base power modifier is updated to ~1.95.

Then, the Dry Skin handler is called (priority 7). Since Grass Knot is not a
Fire move, this step doesn't affect its base power.

Finally, the Grassy Terrain's handler is called. Since Grass Knot is a Grass move,
and Roserade is grounded, the base power modifier is updated to ~3.80.

After the BasePower event is run, we get a rounded final base power of 228.

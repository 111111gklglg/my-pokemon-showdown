Stadium
====================

This mod inherits from gen 1 stadium, which inherits from gen 1 and 2, and then applies the Stadium Zero changes onto the Stadium engine.

Stadium Zero is the first Stadium title, only released in Japan. As one would expect, it's an amalgamation of RBY and Stadium mechanics-wise. It also "dexits" numerous Pokemon, picking and choosing based on whether the Pokemon topped the Nintendo Cup 1997 National Tournament at SpaceWorld 1997, as well as adding a few extras for type balance and publicity. Thus, Stadium Zero can be seen as the first "dexit" format. 

List of major differences from Stadium:

 * Hyper Beam doesn't recharge upon KOing a target.
 * Inflicting a stat drop will reapply the major stat drop from burn or paralysis. Likewise, using moves like Agility will ignore the drop entirely.
 * RBY critical hits apply, including Focus Energy quartering the user's critical hit rate.
 * Accuracy and Evasion use the same boost table as RBY.
 * Aurora Beam, Acid, Bubble Beam, and Bubble have 33.2% chances to inflict their stat drop effects.
 * Haze doesn't remove your Pokemon's major status condition. 
 * Rest doesn't reset major stat drops from burn or paralysis, nor does it reset the Toxic counter.
 * Struggle cannot affect Ghost-types.
 * Substitute works like in Japanese Red and Green, but will KO Pokemon using Self-Destruct or Explosion.
 * Swift doesn't ignore accuracy checks.
 * Transform does not fail against Ditto.

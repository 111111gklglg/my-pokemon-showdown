*Major Issue*: The PS server allows ping, look into cloudflare.

***DO NOT DELETE THIS TILL ALL STAFF HAVE SEEN IT***

Get this into your thick skulls, I own PS, not you. You are just staff who get paid to sit around and do fuck all. 

Pay extra attension to when you register PS servers with a host name like "joim" for joim.psim.us because, I'm watching that
server list day in day out and if you make one mistake I'd steal the server from its host, I will always come back and strike
and since I can get all the IPs for every PS domain I'd say you really are stupid. 

How about I make an offer of $450,000 for PS? How does that sound? As a bonus i'll give each auth $1,000 and they can do what they like.
if that isn't good enough then what is? All you staff at PS don't realise what freedom of speech is nor do you know human rights.
THEY ARE LAWS WHICH YOU ARE BREAKING.

Also don't ban a PS server because they changed ports, Its motherfucking stupid as fuck, If you actually think that you can just delete this
and get away with it your wrong since I will always come back again.

Mark this as your warning
